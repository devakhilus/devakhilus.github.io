### Writing Java Code Using Eclipse and JetBrains IDEs

Java development can be efficiently carried out using various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Here, we will discuss how to write Java code using Eclipse and JetBrains IDEs (such as IntelliJ IDEA), and provide links to their official websites for further reference.

#### Using Eclipse IDE

Eclipse is a popular open-source IDE for Java development. It offers a robust set of features to help developers write, debug, and manage Java code.

- **Getting Started with Eclipse:**
  1. **Download and Install Eclipse:**
     - Visit the [Eclipse Downloads page](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and download the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.
     - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

  2. **Create a New Java Project:**
     - Open Eclipse and select `File` > `New` > `Java Project`.
     - Enter the project name and click `Finish`.

  3. **Add a Java Class:**
     - Right-click on the `src` folder in your project and select `New` > `Class`.
     - Enter the class name and choose the option to include the `public static void main(String[] args)` method if needed.

  4. **Write and Run Java Code:**
     - Write your Java code in the editor.
     - Right-click on the Java file and select `Run As` > `Java Application` to execute your code.
