# Introduction to PHP: Your First Steps

PHP is one of the most widely used server-side scripting languages for web development. In this tutorial, we'll take a beginner-friendly approach to understanding PHP and writing a simple script.

## Getting Started with PHP

PHP scripts are executed on a server, and you can embed PHP within HTML to make dynamic web pages. Below is a simple PHP script to display text on a webpage.

```php
<?php
echo 'Hello From PHP';
echo '<br>';
print 'hai akhil';
echo '<br>';
echo 'Value1', 'value2';
$title = 'Learn PHP From Scratch';
$welcome_Msg = 'Welcome To The Course';
$description = 'In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of the PHP language';
?>
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- `echo` and `print` are used to display text in PHP.
- Variables (`$title`, `$welcome_Msg`, and `$description`) store values that can be dynamically inserted into an HTML document.

## Embedding PHP in HTML

One of PHP’s greatest strengths is its ability to be seamlessly embedded within HTML. The following code demonstrates how PHP can be used to generate dynamic content in a webpage.

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <title><?= $title; ?></title>
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-100">
    <header class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">
        <div class="container mx-auto">
            <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold"><?= $title; ?></h1>
        </div>
    </header>
    <div class="container mx-auto p-4 mt-4">
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4"><?= $welcome_Msg; ?></h2>
            <p><?= $description; ?> </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Understanding the HTML-PHP Integration:
- `<?= $title; ?>` is shorthand for `<?php echo $title; ?>`.
- The page layout is styled using Tailwind CSS for better design.
- Dynamic content is injected using PHP variables.

## Conclusion
This tutorial introduced the basics of PHP scripting and how to embed it into an HTML document. As you progress, you’ll learn more about handling forms, connecting to databases, and creating full-fledged web applications using PHP.
