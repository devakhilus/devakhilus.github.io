# Basic Loops in PHP

## Introduction
Loops are used in PHP to execute the same block of code repeatedly under certain conditions. This tutorial covers the **three fundamental types of loops** in PHP:

- `for`
- `while`
- `do-while`

---

## 1. The `for` Loop

The `for` loop is useful when the number of iterations is known in advance.

### Syntax:
```php
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // code to execute
}
```

### Example:
```php
<?php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    echo "Number: $i<br>";
}
?>
```

### Output:
```
Number: 1  
Number: 2  
Number: 3  
Number: 4  
Number: 5
```

---

## 2. The `while` Loop

The `while` loop checks the condition **before** executing the code block.

### Syntax:
```php
while (condition) {
    // code to execute
}
```

### Example:
```php
<?php
$i = 1;
while ($i <= 5) {
    echo "Count: $i<br>";
    $i++;
}
?>
```

### Output:
```
Count: 1  
Count: 2  
Count: 3  
Count: 4  
Count: 5
```

---

## 3. The `do-while` Loop

The `do-while` loop executes the code **at least once**, and checks the condition **after** the execution.

### Syntax:
```php
do {
    // code to execute
} while (condition);
```

### Example:
```php
<?php
$i = 1;
do {
    echo "Step: $i<br>";
    $i++;
} while ($i <= 5);
?>
```

### Output:
```
Step: 1  
Step: 2  
Step: 3  
Step: 4  
Step: 5
```

## 4. Loop Comparison Table

| Loop Type | Condition Checked | Minimum Execution |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `for`     | Before            | 0 times           |
| `while`   | Before            | 0 times           |
| `do-while`| After             | 1 time            |

---

## Conclusion

- Use `for` loops when you know how many times to loop.
- Use `while` loops when the condition is checked at the beginning.
- Use `do-while` loops when you need the loop to run at least once.

Loops are powerful tools in PHP and are used in tasks such as iteration, validation, and repetitive operations. Practice with different conditions and loop structures to gain confidence.
