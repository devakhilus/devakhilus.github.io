# Arithmetic Operators and Functions in PHP

PHP provides various arithmetic operators and built-in functions to perform mathematical operations efficiently.

## Arithmetic Operators

The following operations demonstrate basic arithmetic in PHP:

```php
<?php
$num1 = 50;
$num2 = 6;

// Basic arithmetic operations
echo "$num1 + $num2 = " . ($num1 + $num2) . "<br>";
echo "$num1 - $num2 = " . ($num1 - $num2) . "<br>";
echo "$num1 * $num2 = " . ($num1 * $num2) . "<br>";
echo "$num1 / $num2 = " . ($num1 / $num2) . "<br>";
echo "$num1 % $num2 = " . ($num1 % $num2) . "<br>";

// Assignment operations
$output = 7;
$output *= 2;
echo "After multiplying by 2: $output <br>";
$output /= 3;
echo "After dividing by 3: $output <br>";
?>
```

### Output:
```
50 + 6 = 56
50 - 6 = 44
50 * 6 = 300
50 / 6 = 8.3333
50 % 6 = 2
After multiplying by 2: 14
After dividing by 3: 4.6667
```

## Built-in Mathematical Functions

### Generating Random Numbers
```php
<?php
echo "Random number: " . rand() . "<br>";
echo "Max random value: " . getrandmax() . "<br>";
echo "Random number between 6 and 27: " . rand(6, 27) . "<br>";
?>
```

### Output (Example):
```
Random number: 1837462
Max random value: 2147483647
Random number between 6 and 27: 14
```

### Rounding Numbers
```php
<?php
echo "Rounded value of 5.78: " . round(5.78) . "<br>";
echo "Ceiling value of 2.2: " . ceil(2.2) . "<br>";
echo "Floor value of 2.9: " . floor(2.9) . "<br>";
?>
```

### Output:
```
Rounded value of 5.78: 6
Ceiling value of 2.2: 3
Floor value of 2.9: 2
```

### Other Mathematical Functions
```php
<?php
echo "Square root of 36: " . sqrt(36) . "<br>";
echo "Value of Pi: " . pi() . "<br>";
echo "Absolute value of -4.2: " . abs(-4.2) . "<br>";
echo "Maximum value among 23, 3, 2, 7, 1: " . max(23, 3, 2, 7, 1) . "<br>";
echo "Minimum value among [22, 13, 5, 6]: " . min([22, 13, 5, 6]) . "<br>";
?>
```

### Output:
```
Square root of 36: 6
Value of Pi: 3.1415926535898
Absolute value of -4.2: 4.2
Maximum value among 23, 3, 2, 7, 1: 23
Minimum value among [22, 13, 5, 6]: 5
```

### Number Formatting
```php
<?php
echo "Formatted number: " . number_format(1234567.123456, 2, '.', ',') . "<br>";
?>
```

### Output:
```
Formatted number: 1,234,567.12
```

## Conclusion
PHP provides a robust set of arithmetic operators and functions for mathematical calculations. These operations are essential for handling numerical data in web applications.
